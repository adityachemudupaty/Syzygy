# The Syzygy Project is a group of developers dedicated to improving the lives of millions of people across the world.
Our goal is to make fitness a lifestyle change instead of a life change.
To that end, we're making a fitness app that interacts with the user, that advises and pushes the user in a way that simple words on a screen ever will.
An app that pushes you, that tells you to work just a little harder, because you're almost there, that's the app we're making.
So please, support us on our journey as we try to help people all across the world just a little bit healthier!
